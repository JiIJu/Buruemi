CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:30 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcartographer.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "cartographer", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "cartographer" with
  any of the following names:

    cartographerConfig.cmake
    cartographer-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "cartographer" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "cartographer_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "cartographer" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
